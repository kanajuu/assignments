    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly
      obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible
      black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's
      inception in 1947.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CIA Director
      <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such
      as:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <br>
        <li>The Cold War</li>
        <li>The civil-rights movement </li>
        <li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
